## General Information
#### You may think yet another CMS... and you're right!(or not) This is my personal journey through space of programming and it is not intended for usage.

I'm still in progress of refactoring core code and for that I need more time... Until I'm done with it there will be no new features.

Roadmap for now is:

* v1 - wrap it up with basic features and admin panel
* v2 - add advanced features
* v3 - refactor it to API that could be used with frontend done in React


## Features

* users can register, login, logout (with username, password, social media)
* remember-me (login via cookie)
* account verification via mail
* failed-login-throttling


## Project Status

* password-forget / reset
* user profiles
